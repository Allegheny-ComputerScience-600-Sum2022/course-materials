# Contract: Senior Thesis, Allegheny College, Summer 2022 (CMPSC 600)

This document outlines relevant guidelines of the Senior Thesis ("Comp") Proposal, describing topic selection, departmental deadlines, and best practices pertaining to work conducted during the `CmPSC 600`. Additionally, this document outlines student evaluation.

## Topic selection

For most students, the partial draft Proposal completed at the end of `CMPSC 580` (Junior Seminar) will dictate your topic selection for completing work in `CMPSC 600`. In most cases, students will develop the work completed during a previous semester into a Comp Proposal. Here development can also include modifications to originally-proposed topics, provided appropriate conversations with assigned First Readers.

### Choosing a new topic

Students may elect to pursue research in an area different than that proposed at the conclusion of the Junior Seminar. Should a student elect this path, the faculty expect that a students will make an appointment to discuss new topics and research viability with their assigned First Reader.

Conversations indicating an entirely new line of research should take place within the opening two (2) weeks of the semester. Failure to act with appropriate urgency may result in students having to pursue either their originally-proposed topic.

In the past, students have successfully chosen to complete Comp projects dramatically different than those proposed during Junior Seminar. However, in these cases, students doing so have chosen topics with which they were still very familiar and recognized that this choice may imply additional work required to keep apace with their peers.

## Student responsibilities

### A note on the nature of the work

Throughout the Comp Proposal process, it is incumbent upon students to schedule meetings with First Readers or to seek out advice and mentorship from additional faculty or advisors. Occasionally, readers may schedule regular, standing meetings with students to discuss work. Students are expected to invest time, energy, and effort in good faith. 

The highly independent and autonomous nature of work associated with the Comp Proposal process assumes a signficant amount of discretionary labor on students' behalf.

## Faculty responsibilities

The faculty of the Department of Computer Science will make an honest, good faith effort to advise students on projects. However, we highlight two peculiar characteristics of feedback given during the Comp process:

1. Feedback, while coming from a place of disciplinary knowledge does not necessarily take into account the breadth and depth students have acquired during their indepdendent research. The faculty expect that students will assume the right to persist in asserting well-informed, even if contrary, opinions -- provided that they are grounded in evidence.

2. Feedback given by faculty often presages deep experience which goes beyond surface-level insights or "cosmetic" changes. Failure to address reader feedback constitutes a serious issue in the research process. This does not mean that students should simply acquiesce to faculty opinion. Rather, students should take up the ability to inquire, challenge, and assess the validity of faculty commentary.

All parties involved in the Comp process acknowledge the relationship between faculty and students involved to be one of peer research. Both parties should assume this to be true in all exchanges and in evaluation of critical feedback.

## Evaluation

A student's default grade in this course is a `C`. 

However, given high-quality deliverables and a commitment to maintaining an equally-demanding process, a student's final grade may increase in proportion to the merits of the work provided. This rule also contemplates that a student's grade may suffer in the same proportion. Merely meeting basic criteria listed below usually presages "average" work. 

### Criteria

All assignments will be ranked according to the following evaluation schedule:

|Outcome |Indication                                 |
|:-------|:------------------------------------------|
|â›”      |Requirement missing or not adequately addressed |
|ðŸ†—      |Requirement adequately addressed |
|âœ…      |Requirement exceeds expecations |

Each assignment carries assignment-specific grade penalties, though each is eligible for a âœ… mark, indicating that work exceeds reader expectations. Each âœ…   will increase a student's letter grade by a full letter. Likewise, each â›” reduces a student's final grade by 1 full letter.

##### Process journals

Students are required to submit weekly entries to the process journal repository. These should take a form dictated by the process journal GitHub Classroom assignment. 

|Outcome |Description                                |
|:-------|:------------------------------------------|
|â›”      |For every two (2) entries missing, student's letter grade decreases by a full mark|
|ðŸ†—      |All work is present and meets minimum requirements  |
|âœ…      |Work submitted exceeds standard quality expected |

##### Proposal document

The following should be taken as a list of strong general recommendations for your proposal documents. These categories double as areas the faculty use to both assess work for completeness.

- [ ] Proposal was submitted on time
- [ ] The title of the proposal is appropriate
- [ ] The abstract provides a concise summary
- [ ] The introduction section clearly describes the proposed work
- [ ] The introduction section motivates the proposed work
- [ ] The related work section describes relevant literature
- [ ] The related work section situates the proposed project in the broader scope
- [ ] The method section explains the process to be utilized in the proposed study
- [ ] The method section includes at least one of the following: the description of algorithms, programming languages, libraries, platforms,  software tools, hardware
- [ ] The method section includes a demonstration of feasibility
- [ ] The evaluation section describes how the work will be validated
- [ ] The proposal includes a detailed schedule	The conclusion section discusses the impact of the proposed work
- [ ] The conclusion outlines avenues for future work
- [ ] The proposal includes at least twelve references
- [ ] The proposal consists of at least `3000` words
- [ ] The proposal includes visual aids, where appropriate, which fall under the broad categories of:
 * `image`
 * `figure`
 * `table`
 * `graph`
- [ ] There are no typographical or grammatical errors and no extraneous text in the proposal
- [ ] The proposal was released correctly on GitHub

|Outcome |Indication                                 |
|:-------|:------------------------------------------|
|â›”      |30% or more of requirements are missing from document |
|ðŸ†—      |All work is present and meets minimum requirements  |
|âœ…      |Work submitted exceeds standard quality expected |

#### Proposal defense

Proposal defenses take the form of a live oral presentation of between 10 and 15 minutes. Time is dedicated as follows:

* 10 minutes: student presentation
* 5 minutes: questions posed by First and Second readers in succession
* brief deliberation of Proposal document and presentation, during which the presenting student leaves the room

After deliberation, the First Reader indicates if the presenter has passed the Proposal stage.

|Outcome |Indication                                 |
|:-------|:------------------------------------------|
|â›”      |Student must remount full defense |
|ðŸ†—      |"Conditional" passage; student must follow up in method prescribed by readers|
|âœ…      |Defense exceeds expectations and demonstrates superior work |

#### Passing the proposal defense

If a student passes the Proposal defense, they are permitted to continue work on developing two (2) draft chapters of their thesis document.

#### "Conditional" passage

In some cases, the changes required by faculty review of student work require significant revision and labor, but not so much so that student work is considered as "not passing." In these cases, a student's readers may come up with certain contingencies that must be fulfilled before judging a project to have passed the defense.

Should a student require these follow-up interventions, their First Reader will open an issue on the student's proposal repository containing the requested revisions. Once a student makes these revisions, and they have been accepted by a student's readers, the student will be notified that they have passed their defense.

#### Not passing the proposal defense

Should readers determine that a student _does not_ pass the Proposal defense, changes will be requested via issues filed on the GitHub repository containing the Proposal document. In addition, the student will be asked to attend a follow-up defense. During this follow-up defense, students are expected to address the gaps identified by the previous defense.
